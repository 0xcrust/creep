## ThirtyFour stealth

A plugin for [thirtyfour](https://github.com/stevepryde/thirtyfour), a Rust-based Selenium webdriver built on top of [Fantoccini](https://github.com/jonhoo/fantoccini). This library lets your thirtyfour driver pass basic fingerprint tests to avoid detection.

This project is based on the work done in [puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth), and [selenium-stealth](https://github.com/diprajpatra/selenium-stealth).


## Usage
Examples can be found in the `/examples` directory, and their results in `/example/results`.
